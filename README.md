LazerScannerUWP is a software design project made my senior year of college at the University of Washington - Tacoma. 
Its application name is Pantry Manager and is an inventory manager for home use. Using an API from UPCItemDB this applicaiton is able to look up item from their barcodes and add them to the users inventory. Inventory is stored on a remote SQL server and is organized by a SQL generated unique ID.
